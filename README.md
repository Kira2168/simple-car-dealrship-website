🧪 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL (data.sql)


Tailwind is included via CDN in the HTML head, so no local build tools are required for styling.


---

🔐 Login Page

The login page uses Tailwind CSS via CDN to ensure styling works without a build step.

No framework setup is needed. Just ensure you have internet access to load the Tailwind CDN.

📄 Notes

Make sure to import the data.sql file to avoid database errors.

Use Firefox, Chrome, or any modern browser for best compatibility.

Do not forget to run XAMPP before trying to access the site.
